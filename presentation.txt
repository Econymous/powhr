Remaining Concern:
	- Is inflationary defense good enough?

Get out the way
	shit I don't want to hear about:
		- marketing budget
		- how I suck at communication

	Disclaimers:
		- This is going to sound too good to be true
		- I'm going to talk my shit as if it was delivered from satoshi's mouth directly

	Hype:
		- Infinity stone
			It's not the end all, be all, but it's a mother fucking infinity stone.


3 things that all true blockchain enthusiast hate
	- proof of stake
	- scammy token sales
	- pyramid schemes

	-Most people lose


What's the move?
	Potentials:
		-Scaling Solution ( Mesh of Chains / BFT )
		-lvl1 IPFS killer ( BSV variable block size )
		-Crowdsourcing creative content
		-Truly Unique Value. Fork Resistent (beacuse they can't fork all of the sidechain)
		-Distributed Ownership of Hardware
			-GPS
			-Proof of Manufacturing
			-Privacy / Trusted Execution Environments
			-lvl2 IPFS killer (dedicated and secured storage devices)
			-Decentralize Social Networks, MMORPGs, and Other services

Mechanics of Distribution:
	-Buy & Sell of the Pyramid
	-Loss & Hodl multipliers * ETH => Resolves
	-Dissolving for Dividends
------------------------------------
	-Color Token { RNS | Governance Fund => SideChain }
		-Affiliate

Variations:
	-Half Lock, Half Pyramid. Good for governance that doesn't need a lot of money involved.
	-Migrating existing tokens to a real tokenomics model. Stake existing tokens for a % on all resolve returns, or for divs
	-Hard coding in a developer fund where resolve token holders can vote on who to hire
